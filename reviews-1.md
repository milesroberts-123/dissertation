***Please note, as of the beginning of Fall 2022 we switched over to a new formatting guide. This new guide is less restrictive so if you followed the previous guide, your document should still be on track. Your corrections will be based off the new guide, which will simplify some things. *** You can find the updated formatting guide here: https://grad.msu.edu/etd  

- [x] Previously published material: if you have included previously published material (chapters, figures, tables, etc.) in your dissertation, you must obtain permission from the publisher(s) to reprint the material. Please upload all permissions to the copyright section of your ProQuest account. The copyright section is in the PDF option, just below where you upload current versions of your document to ProQuest. 

- [x] Abstract: There should be one double space between the heading and first line of text. Currently there is too much space here. We measure one double space by the amount of space between the lines of text in the body of the document. 

- [x] Dedication: this should be page iv. The previous pages were counted but not numbered. Please note this will change all of the page numbers for the preliminary pages.  

- [x] Acknowledgements: There should be one double space between the heading and first line of text. Currently there is too much space here. We measure one double space by the amount of space between the lines of text in the body of the document. 

- [x] Preface: There should be one double space between the heading and first line of text. Currently there is too much space here. We measure one double space by the amount of space between the lines of text in the body of the document. 

- [x] Table of Contents: please note that we no longer require all subheadings to be listed. You may keep the level one subheadings if you want, but we ask you remove anything beyond a level one subheading. The more listings the longer the review process will take as we must ensure that each entry matches in the TABLE OF CONTENTS and the document in terms of capitalization, punctuation, and wording. Please look at our updated sample pages for our simplified TABLE OF CONTENTS options.

- [x] Table of Contents: There should be one double space between chapter entries and single space within chapters. Currently, it is all single spaced. See sample pages for examples of how to format this page.  

- [x] Page 1: Spacing: The text of the Abstract, Acknowledgements, Preface, and general text of the body of the manuscript may be 1.5-spaced or double-spaced and must be consistent throughout the document. Currently there is too much space between the heading INTRODUCTION and the first line of text. Please address this. There appears to be an extra blank line.  

- [x] Page 4: Subheading “Abstract”: This is a level one subheading because it is the first subheading to appear in this chapter. Currently, level one subheadings are listed in the TABLE OF CONTENTS but this one is not. Please address this.  

- [x] Page 4: Spacing: The text of the Abstract, Acknowledgements, Preface, and general text of the body of the manuscript may be 1.5-spaced or double-spaced and must be consistent throughout the document. Currently there is too much space above and below the subheading “Abstract”. Please address this.  

- [x] Page 4: Subheading “Introduction”: the formatting does not match the TABLE OF CONTENTS in terms or wording. All headings must match in the TABLE OF CONTENTS and the document in terms of wording, capitalization, and punctuation. Currently the TABLE OF CONTENTS lists “1.1: Introduction” but here there is no numbering or punctuation. Please address this.  

- [x] Page 4: Spacing: The text of the Abstract, Acknowledgements, Preface, and general text of the body of the manuscript may be 1.5-spaced or double-spaced and must be consistent throughout the document. Currently there is too much space above and below the subheading “Introduction”. Please address this. 

- [x] Page 7: Subheading “Methods”: the formatting does not match the TABLE OF CONTENTS in terms or wording or punctuation. All headings must match in the TABLE OF CONTENTS and the document in terms of wording, capitalization, and punctuation. Currently the TABLE OF CONTENTS lists “1.2: Methods” but here there is no numbering or punctuation. Please address this. 

- [x] Page 7: Spacing: The text of the Abstract, Acknowledgements, Preface, and general text of the body of the manuscript may be 1.5-spaced or double-spaced and must be consistent throughout the document. Currently there is too much space between the subheading “Methods” and the next subheading. There should be one double space here.  

- [x] Page 7: Spacing: The text of the Abstract, Acknowledgements, Preface, and general text of the body of the manuscript may be 1.5-spaced or double-spaced and must be consistent throughout the document. Currently there is too much space between the subheading that begins with “RNA-seq run...” and the start of the next paragraph. Please address this.  

- [ ] ENTIRE DOCUMENT: Spacing: The text of the Abstract, Acknowledgements, Preface, and general text of the body of the manuscript may be 1.5-spaced or double-spaced and must be consistent throughout the document. Currently there is too much space above and below every subheading in the document. Please address this on every page. No further comments will be given about this issue. Please check to make sure the spacing is set to 0. If you are using Word, that can be found in the Home tab---Paragraph section---Indents and Spacing---Spacing. The “Before” should be set at 0pt and “After” should be set at 0pt. Or remove any blank lines between subheadings and paragraphs. This may help fix the issue. 

- [x] Page 29: Subheading “Data Availability”: This is formatted as a level one subheading but does not appear in the TABLE OF CONTENTS. Please address this. Please make this change for every level one subheading in the document. You must be consistent with formatting, numbering, and adding them to the TABLE OF CONTENTS. If you choose to list one level one subheading, you must list all level one subheadings in the TABLE OF CONTENTS. Please note this comment would no longer apply if you removed all subheadings from the TABLE OF CONTENTS.
